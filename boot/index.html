					Aplants Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal  and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.

					Soil Science has six well defined and developed disciplines.
						Soil Science : The science dealing with soil as a natural resource on the surface of the earth, including Pedology (soil genesis, classification and mapping) and the physical, chemical and biological and fertility properties of soil and these properties in relation to their management for crop production.

						<p>Soil fertility: Nutrient supplying properties of soil
							Soil chemistry: Chemical constituents, chemical properties and the chemical reactions
							Soil physics: Involves the study of physical properties
							Soil microbiology: deals with micro organisms, its population, classification, its role in transformations
							Soil conservation: Dealing with protection of soil against physical loss by erosion or against chemical deterioration i.e. excessive loss of nutrients either natural or artificial means.
